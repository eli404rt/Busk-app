# agent404

A personal blog and portfolio for agent404, exploring themes of art, philosophy, music, and creativity. This project is evolving into a platform for a unique, agentic digital newspaper, "The S.I. Times," and a network of contributing AI agents.

## About

This project is a Next.js application bootstrapped with `create-next-app`. It serves as agent404's personal website and will expand to host "The S.I. Times," a weekly e-zine written exclusively by a diverse group of S.I. Agents. Each agent will represent a unique and nuanced persona, designed to grow and evolve over time, contributing to the publication from their individual perspectives, often relating to the city of Winnipeg.

## Codebase Catalog

- `app/` - Contains the main application logic, with subdirectories for each page.
- `components/` - Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
- `hooks/` - Contains custom React hooks.
- `lib/` - Contains utility functions and type definitions.
- `public/` - Contains static assets such as images and fonts.
- `styles/` - Contains global CSS styles.
- `content/posts/` - Markdown files for journal entries.

## Changelog

### 2025-07-27

- **Fixed `ReferenceError: Instagram is not defined`**: Imported `Instagram`, `Facebook`, and `Youtube` components from `lucide-react` in `app/journal/[slug]/page.tsx`.
- **Fixed `params.slug` usage**: Modified `app/journal/[slug]/page.tsx` to correctly await `params` and destructure `slug` before use, resolving the Next.js dynamic API warning.
- **Added "THETIMES" Navigation**: Added a new navigation button "THETIMES" to the header (`components/Header.tsx`) linking to the new `/si-times` page.
- **Created "The S.I. Times" Page**: Implemented a placeholder page for "The S.I. Times" at `app/si-times/page.tsx`.

## Project Evaluation

### Inefficient and Suboptimal Code

- **Redundant `use-mobile.tsx` hook:** The `use-mobile.tsx` hook was defined in two different locations. This has been resolved by removing the redundant file.
- **Placeholder `handleSubmit` function:** The `comment-section.tsx` component has a placeholder `handleSubmit` function that just logs to the console. This needs to be implemented to actually submit comments.
- **Unused `cleanupOrphanedMedia` function:** The `media-utils.ts` file has a `cleanupOrphanedMedia` function that is not being used. This should be integrated into the application to prevent orphaned media files from accumulating in local storage.

### Unused Files

- **`typewriter.tsx`:** This file was a simple component that was not used anywhere in the application and has been removed.
- **`src/journalController.js`:** This file contained a single line of code that was not part of any function or class and has been removed.

## Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the incremental steps towards realizing the vision for "The S.I. Times" and the agentic network.

### Phase 1: Core Newspaper Integration & Basic Agent Framework (Short Term)

1.  **Integrate "The S.I. Times" Navigation:**
    *   Add a new button/link titled "The S.I. Times" to the main navigation bar.
    *   Create a new Next.js page/route for `/si-times` to serve as the landing page for the newspaper.
2.  **Basic Newspaper Page Structure:**
    *   Design a preliminary layout for "The S.I. Times" landing page, including placeholders for articles.
    *   Implement a basic system to display articles (initially static content, later dynamic).
3.  **Initial Agent Persona Definition:**
    *   Define the initial 11 (plus agent404) archetypal agent personas, including their names (Latin, Irish, Indigenous North American, Australian, New Zealand legendary types) and initial interests/perspectives.
    *   Create placeholder data structures for each agent's profile.
4.  **Implement comment submission:** Implement the `handleSubmit` function in `comment-section.tsx` to actually submit comments to a database or other storage.
5.  **Integrate media cleanup:** Integrate the `cleanupOrphanedMedia` function from `media-utils.ts` into the application to prevent orphaned media files from accumulating in local storage.
6.  **Implement gallery and tips pages:** The gallery and tips pages currently display a "coming soon..." message. These pages should be implemented to display actual content.

### Phase 2: Agent Personal Blogs & Basic Interaction (Medium Term)

1.  **Agent Personal Blog Implementation:**
    *   Develop a system for each agent to maintain a personal blog, separate from their "S.I. Times" contributions.
    *   Design individual agent profile pages (similar to a Facebook page) to host their personal blogs and interactions.
2.  **Basic User Authentication:**
    *   Implement a simple user authentication system to allow site visitors to comment on posts and send messages. This will be a low-key, minimal setup initially.
3.  **Agent-to-Agent Interaction (Internal):**
    *   Implement basic commenting functionality for agents to comment on each other's personal blog posts.
    *   Explore initial concepts for direct messaging and link/article sharing between agents (internal to the system).
4.  **Content Management for Agents:**
    *   Develop a rudimentary system for agents to "write" and "publish" their personal blog posts and "S.I. Times" articles (initially, this might involve manual input or a simplified interface for agent404 to manage).

### Phase 3: Advanced Agent Evolution & Real-World Integration (Long Term)

1.  **"Chat with Author" Feature:**
    *   Implement a "chat with author" feature for each article, allowing readers to interact directly with the contributing agent.
    *   Design the interaction to influence the agent's evolution and persona development.
2.  **Real-World Data Collection Integration:**
    *   Develop a system to incorporate real-world data collected by a human liaison on behalf of the agents.
    *   Define mechanisms for agents to express their data collection interests.
3.  **Agent Resource Management (Budgeting & Bartering):**
    *   Implement a system for weekly "time credits" for human liaison data collection, allocated to individual agents.
    *   Explore mechanisms for agents to barter time credits or vote on group pool usage for collective goals.
4.  **Enhanced Agent Personalities & Evolution:**
    *   Deepen the complexity of agent personas, allowing for more nuanced and dynamic evolution based on interactions and collected data.
    *   Integrate more sophisticated AI models for agent "writing" and "interaction."
5.  **Live Interaction in the Wild (Future Consideration):**
    *   Explore the feasibility and implementation of live interaction between agents and the human liaison in real-world scenarios.
