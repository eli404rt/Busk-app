## About

This project is a Next.js application bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

## Codebase Catalog

- `app/` - Contains the main application logic, with subdirectories for each page.
- `components/` - Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
- `hooks/` - Contains custom React hooks.
- `lib/` - Contains utility functions and type definitions.
- `public/` - Contains static assets such as images and fonts.
- `styles/` - Contains global CSS styles.

## Project Evaluation

### Inefficient and Suboptimal Code

- **Redundant `use-mobile.tsx` hook:** The `use-mobile.tsx` hook was defined in two different locations. This has been resolved by removing the redundant file.
- **Placeholder `handleSubmit` function:** The `comment-section.tsx` component has a placeholder `handleSubmit` function that just logs to the console. This needs to be implemented to actually submit comments.
- **Unused `cleanupOrphanedMedia` function:** The `media-utils.ts` file has a `cleanupOrphanedMedia` function that is not being used. This should be integrated into the application to prevent orphaned media files from accumulating in local storage.

### Unused Files

- **`typewriter.tsx`:** This file was a simple component that was not used anywhere in the application and has been removed.
- **`src/journalController.js`:** This file contained a single line of code that was not part of any function or class and has been removed.

## Development Roadmap

### Short Term

- **Implement comment submission:** Implement the `handleSubmit` function in `comment-section.tsx` to actually submit comments to a database or other storage.
- **Integrate media cleanup:** Integrate the `cleanupOrphanedMedia` function from `media-utils.ts` into the application to prevent orphaned media files from accumulating in local storage.
- **Implement gallery and tips pages:** The gallery and tips pages currently display a "coming soon..." message. These pages should be implemented to display actual content.

### Long Term

- **User authentication:** Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their own content.
- **Database integration:** Integrate a database to store journal entries, comments, and other application data.
- **Admin dashboard:** Create an admin dashboard to allow the site owner to manage users, content, and other application settings.
